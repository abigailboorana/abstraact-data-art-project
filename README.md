# Unit 4 - Abstract Art Project

## Introduction

Data visualizations are powerful tools to present information and convey patterns and relationships. Sometimes visualizations are charts or graphs, and other times they are more abstract pieces of art. Your goal is to create a visual representation relating at least two categories from your dataset that engages your viewer and encourages them to learn more about your chosen topic.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, one-dimensional (1D) arrays, and algorithms to create your data visualization program:

- **Create at least two 1D arrays** – Create at least two 1D arrays to store the data that will make up your visualization.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use two-way or multi-selection statements with compound Boolean expressions to analyze the data.
- **Use methods in the Math class** – Use one or more methods in the Math class in your program, such as to perform calculations on the values in your dataset and display the results, choose random values from the dataset, or display images or shapes at random locations.
- **Create a visualization** – Create an image or animation that conveys the story of the data by illustrating the patterns or relationships in the data.
  Note: This may be abstract! Others do not necessarily need to know what the story or pattern is right away, but you do need to be able to explain it to them.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Dataset

DataSet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ybndu2EF51z0fioSWewB1tVqWnHF9HoX6xFCqUyZm7g/edit?gid=975672932#gid=975672932

-**Year** (Int) - the winning year

-**Category** (String) - the category of the winners

-**Nominee** (String) - the name of the artist/ group nominated

## Video Demo

Record a short video of your abstract art animation to display here on your README. You can do this by:

- Screen record your project running on Code.org.
- Upload that recording to YouTube.
- Take a thumbnail for your image.
- Upload the thumbnail image to your repo.
- Use the following markdown

## Description

For Jalyssa and I's Abstract Data Art Project, we chose to look at the Grammy Winners dataset. Our project is primarily used to inform the users about the Grammy winners from a specific year and category. Our project also informs the users about the artists/ groups that were nominated and won. We used static variables and instance methods to display the information in the console log. For our animations, we added two different types of sound effects to grab the users' attention while using the program.
